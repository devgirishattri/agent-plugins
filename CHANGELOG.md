# Changelog

## session-workspace 0.6.4 — 2026-09-23

- Require `rg --no-config` as the prefix for reviewer and scoped executor
  ripgrep reads, preventing inherited configuration from enabling symlink
  traversal or preprocessors.
- Reject hostname-program and compressed-search options in the restricted read
  grammar. General executor in-checkout shell permissions remain unchanged.
- Add real ripgrep controls for hostile configuration and normal searches on
  both provider trees.

## knowledge 0.3.28 — 2026-09-19

- Fix a docs-taxonomy scanner false positive: the exact `docs/decisions/README.md`
  folder index no longer requires decision naming or `decided` metadata. It remains
  covered by documentation link, freshness, and TODO checks.
- Fix memory-backlinks scanner false positives: fenced code blocks and single-backtick inline
  code spans no longer contribute links, warnings, or dangling counts in any
  graph mode. Prose links retain their existing resolution behavior.
